          <h2>Prolegomenon</h2>
            <h4>Basic Python Programming for Biologists is written to introduce biologists to the world of programming! This book assumes that its readers are absolute beginners in the field of programming. They have no prior knowledge of any programming languages and their allied fields. So, anybody with a little perseverance and curiosity is humbly invited! Though this book is intended for biologists interested in programming, it will also cater to the needs of enthusiasts from other fields, as above all, Python remains the DNA of this book. Basic concepts and grammar (a.k.a. ‘syntax’) of Python remains the same for all fields. Rest be assured after you complete the book religiously, you can upgrade your Python Programmer status from the ‘Absolute Beginner’ to  ‘Ready for Intermediate’! So think ‘pythonically’, feel ‘The Zen of Python’ and enjoy coding!</h4>
