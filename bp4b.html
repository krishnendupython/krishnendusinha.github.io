          <h2>Prolegomenon</h2>
              <h4>Basic Python Programming for Biologists is written to introduce biologists to 
                the world of programming! This book assumes that its readers are absolute beginners
                in the field of programming. They have no prior knowledge of any programming languages 
                and their allied fields. So, anybody with a little perseverance and curiosity is humbly 
                invited! Though this book is intended for biologists interested in programming, it 
                will also cater to the needs of enthusiasts from other fields, as above all, Python remains
                the DNA of this book. Basic concepts and grammar (a.k.a. ‘syntax’) of Python remains 
                the same for all fields. Rest be assured after you complete the book religiously, you can 
                upgrade your Python Programmer status from the ‘Absolute Beginner’ to ‘Ready for Intermediate’!
                So think ‘pythonically’, feel ‘The Zen of Python’ and enjoy coding!</h4>
